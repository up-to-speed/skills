# Walkthrough

Generate a code walkthrough through a locally-running Command Center, then open it.

## When to invoke

The user asks for a walkthrough of the current branch, a pull request, a commit range, or "explain the diff". Examples:

- "Give me a walkthrough of this branch."
- "Walk me through the changes since main."
- "Generate a walkthrough for HEAD~5..HEAD."

## How to invoke

Run the runner. The runner does all the work — installation detection, backend startup, auth/model/workspace checks, walkthrough generation, and browser open.

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/walkthrough/run.mjs" [from..to]
```

`[from..to]` is optional. When omitted, the runner defaults to `merge-base(HEAD, main)..HEAD`.

## Interpreting the output

The runner prints one JSON object per line on stdout. Each line has a `kind` field:

- `kind: "status"` — progress update; surface a brief one-line note to the user.
- `kind: "result"` — terminal success; the runner has opened the walkthrough. Tell the user it opened and include the URL from `url`.
- `kind: "error"` — terminal failure; tell the user what went wrong using the `code` and `message` fields. Codes are stable enums (`not-installed`, `not-running`, `not-logged-in`, `no-model`, `quota`, `no-workspace`, `backend-too-old`, `generation-failed`, etc.); the `message` is already in the user's language.
- `kind: "action-required"` — the user must do something before re-running (e.g. install the app, sign in, configure a model). Surface the `message` and the `url` if present.

Always surface the runner's `message` verbatim — do not rephrase. The runner produces user-facing strings in English; backend-originated strings are already localized.

## Non-zero exit codes

The runner exits 0 on success and a small fixed integer on failure (one code per failure kind, documented in the project README). Do not parse the exit code — branch on the structured `kind` / `code` fields above.
